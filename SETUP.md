# Auto-Quantify — Setup Guide

This guide lets you run the auto-quantify bot on **your own** GitHub
account, for free, with **no computer required**. Once set up, GitHub's servers
will log into the service and click the "quantify" button for you automatically,
several times a day.

You do **not** need to know how to code. Just follow each step in order.
The whole thing takes about **10 minutes**.

---

## What you need

- A phone number + password for your account (the one you log in with).
- About 10 minutes.

---

## Step 1 — Create a free GitHub account

1. Go to **https://github.com/signup**
2. Enter your email, pick a password, pick a username.
3. Verify your email when GitHub asks.

That's it — a free account is all you need.

---

## Step 2 — Fork (copy) the bot into your account

"Forking" just means making your own personal copy of the project.

1. While logged in, open this link:
   **https://github.com/uh60down/vb-auto**
2. In the top-right corner, click the **Fork** button.
3. On the next screen, leave everything as-is and click **Create fork**.

You now have your own copy at `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/vb-auto`.
Everything from here happens in **your** copy.

---

## Step 3 — Turn on Actions (this is required for forks)

GitHub turns off automation on forks by default, so you must enable it once.

1. In **your** copy of the repo, click the **Actions** tab (top menu).
2. You'll see a message saying workflows are disabled. Click the green button:
   **"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"**.

Done. Automation is now allowed.

---

## Step 4 — Add your login (Secrets)

These are stored **encrypted** and are only used by the bot to log in. Nobody,
including the project owner, can read them.

1. In your repo, click **Settings** (top menu).
2. In the left sidebar, click **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**.
3. Click the green **New repository secret** button and add the **first** secret:

   - **Name:** `VB_ID_CODE`
   - **Secret:** your country code, written **with the plus sign**, e.g. `+82`
   - Click **Add secret**.

4. Click **New repository secret** again and add the **second** secret:

   - **Name:** `VB_ID_PHONENUMBER`
   - **Secret:** your phone number **without** the country code, e.g. `1012345678`
   - Click **Add secret**.

5. Click **New repository secret** one more time and add the **third** secret:

   - **Name:** `VB_PASSWORD`
   - **Secret:** your account password
   - Click **Add secret**.

> ⚠️ The three names must be **exactly** as written above (all capital letters,
> with underscores). A typo here is the most common reason the bot fails.

When finished, your Secrets page should list exactly three secrets:
`VB_ID_CODE`, `VB_ID_PHONENUMBER`, `VB_PASSWORD`.

---

## Step 5 — Test it once (manually)

Let's make sure it works before leaving it on autopilot.

1. Click the **Actions** tab.
2. On the left, click the **Auto Quantify** workflow.
3. On the right, click the **Run workflow** button → then the green
   **Run workflow** confirmation button.
4. Wait about 1–2 minutes. Refresh the page.
5. A new run appears. If it has a **green check ✅**, it worked! 🎉
   If it has a **red X ❌**, see Troubleshooting below.

---

## Step 6 — That's it — it now runs automatically

You don't need to do anything else. GitHub will automatically run the bot
**several times every hour** (at :07, :17, :27 and :47) and stop once your daily
quantify limit is used up. Your phone/PC can be off — it all runs on GitHub's servers.

> **Important — about GitHub's schedule:** GitHub's free scheduler is
> "best effort", not a guarantee. When GitHub's servers are busy, a scheduled
> time can be **delayed by several minutes, or skipped entirely**. This is normal
> GitHub behavior and there is nothing wrong with your setup.
>
> That's exactly why the bot is scheduled **several times per hour** (:07, :17,
> :27, :47) instead of once: even if some slots get skipped, a later slot still
> runs and your daily quantify limit still gets used up. You don't need to do
> anything — just let it run.

---

## Troubleshooting

**The test run failed (red ❌).**
Click the failed run, then click the **quantify** job to read the log.

- **Most common cause:** a secret name is misspelled or a value is wrong.
  Go back to Step 4 and check that the three names are exactly
  `VB_ID_CODE`, `VB_ID_PHONENUMBER`, `VB_PASSWORD`, and that:
  - `VB_ID_CODE` starts with a `+` (e.g. `+82`)
  - `VB_ID_PHONENUMBER` has **no** country code in it
  - `VB_PASSWORD` is your correct password
- After fixing a secret, just run the test again (Step 5).

**I don't see scheduled runs appearing on their own.**
Two reasons, both normal:
1. A brand-new fork can take an hour or two before the automatic schedule starts.
   Give it some time.
2. GitHub's free scheduler skips runs when its servers are busy, so an individual
   slot (e.g. :17) may not fire. Wait for the next slot — it usually catches up.

The manual test (Step 5) always works immediately regardless, so use that if you
ever want to force a run right now.

**I want to stop the bot.**
Go to **Actions** → **Auto Quantify** → the **•••** menu → **Disable workflow**.

## Quick reference

| Secret name          | What to put                          | Example       |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------|
| `VB_ID_CODE`         | Country code **with** `+`            | `+82`         |
| `VB_ID_PHONENUMBER`  | Phone number **without** country code| `1012345678`  |
| `VB_PASSWORD`        | Your account password                | `••••••••`    |

Runs automatically at **:07, :17, :27 and :47 every hour**. Nothing else to do. ✅
